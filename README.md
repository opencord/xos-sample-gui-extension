# xos-sample-gui-extension

## Demo

To run this demo we suggest to setup `xos` using the `Vagrant` VM provided in the `fronted` configuration, but it is enabled for all the configuration.

### Setup the extension container

From any `service-profile` folder execute: `make xos_gui_sample_extension_c`

> This command will build the container image (It is automatically triggered by the next command).

### Onboard the GUI extension

From any `service-profile` folder execute: `make ui-sample-extension`
